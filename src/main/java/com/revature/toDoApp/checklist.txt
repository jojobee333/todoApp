As a user, I can create a new To-Do [X]
As a user, I can view all To-Dos [X]
As a user, I can view a singular To-Do by its ID (HINT: Use Path Params to select a To-Do by its ID) [X]
As a user, I can update a To-Do (Change the title, mark it complete/incomplete) [X]

Other Optional Requirements include the following:

Using JUnit to test Service Layer methods (70% coverage at least would be optimal)
Switching the H2 Database for the SQL Server database we created on 2/5/2024o-Dos by topics (HINT: This should use Query Params on a previously created handler for viewing To-Dos and would require an additional field on the ToDo Class
